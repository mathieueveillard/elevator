# Elevator kata

In this kata, one must implement the core engine of a batch of elevators working together, with the following features:

- A person must specify the destination floor before entering an elevator. It is up to the engine to determine which elevator is best suited to fulfill their request;
- If many persons are going to the same destination, each one must request for an elevator;
- Elevators have a limited capacity (i.e. maximum number of passengers).
